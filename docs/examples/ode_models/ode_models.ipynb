    "To save having to write a separate databook, we can insert the value for `I_0` (the initial number of people infected) as a default value in the framework file. We will also set the initial number recovered to `0`. We omit the number of susceptible people and do not have the compartment appear in the databook, so that it can be computed based on the total population size.\n",

    "By including this characteristic in the databook, we are able to replicate the calculation from the explicit ODE model above, with `y0 = np.array([N-I_0,I_0,0])` - we have defined values for `N`, `I_0`, and set the initial number of recovered to `0`, and Atomica will carry out the initialization using these values to calculate the initial number susceptible as `N-I_0`. \n",

    "- The parameter value is positive/unsigned, similar to the `new_inf` variable above. When this quantity acts on compartment sizes, the sign (negative for the outflow in `dS = -new_inf`, positive in `dI = +new_inf...`) comes from the transition matrix\n",
    "- In Atomica, when a transition is defined between one compartment and another, the number of people to move is calculated (for a parameter in 'rate' units) by multiplying the parameter value by the size of the compartment that people are flowing out of. This allows us to define the function for the `foi` parameter consistent with the traditional definition 'the rate at which susceptible people become infected' i.e., a rate that is be multiplied by the number of susceptible people to calculate the number of new infections. Hence this parameter is defined as `N_c*θ*I/N` without `S` appearing in the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to write out the transition matrix. For the SIR model, only two transitions are required. Notice that we can specify the duration-related transition directly by setting the duration `τ_i` as the transition parameter. This will automatically drive the transition using the inverse of the duration as the equivalent rate (`1/τ_i`) so it is not necessary to define an additional parameter for this.   \n",
