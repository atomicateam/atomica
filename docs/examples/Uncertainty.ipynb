For uncertainty, the simplest option is to construct a `PlotData` object containing the required cascade values, and to generate the plot via `Ensemble.plot_bars` (the key difference between `Ensemble.plot_bars` and `plotting.plot_bars` is that `Ensemble.plot_bars` doesn't support any stacking - which would be potentially misleading with uncertainty - and therefore supports arbitrary ordering of the bars, whereas `plotting.plot_bars` requires that the inner group consist of outputs or pops only, as these are the only valid stacking targets). \n",

A large model might have on the order of 150 parameters, 50 compartments, and 150 links. A typical `Ensemble` may have track 5-10 quantities, which represents a ~50x reduction in size. Further, the raw output has values at every timestep, which could be on the order of 100 values (e.g. a 25 year simulation with quarterly timesteps) but it may only be desired to compare simulations for a few time points - which could provide another ~20x reduction in size. \n",
