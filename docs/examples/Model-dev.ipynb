This conversion depends on the units that the parameter is in, and is performed here.

This allows variables to control how they unlink themselves, which is important because some variables have references that others do not (e.g., `Characteristics` have `includes` while `Parameters` have `deps`). At the end of this process, the variables are only stored once in the `Population` lists e.g. `Population.comps()`\n",
