    "\n",
    "1. Converting between (mean) durations and probabilities - for example, when users enter a treatment duration, this needs to be converted into a probability of leaving the treatment compartment due to treatment completion\n",
    "2. Converting probabilities when the time step changes. For a fixed underlying rate, the probability of making a transition increases with time. Probabilities therefore need to be adjusted when the timestep changes to preserve the model's behaviour, and to converge to a prediction in the limit of small step sizes. \n",

Consider what happens in the case where we have a mean duration that is exactly the same as the simulation timestep. With discrete simulation timesteps, we _enforce_ that the minimum time spent in a state is one timestep. So when computing the time taken to empty the compartment, if anyone takes longer than one timestep, the mean time taken to transition must necessarily be higher than 1. The timestep imposes a minimum value for the mean duration. However, if `dt=dur` then `(1.0 - np.exp(-dt/dur)))` means that only 63% of people make the transition in the first timestep.

    "### Preserving durations vs preserving annual flows\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the motivation for the original timestep conversion was to preserve the annual flow. For instance, suppose there were 100 people in a compartment, and an annual transition probability of 0.6. This would mean that in the first timestep, 60 people would transition out of the compartment. If we had a timestep of 0.25 and use the conversion `P = 1-(1-0.6)**0.25 = 0.204` then the number of people remaining after 4 timesteps would be `100*(1-0.204)^4 = 40`. So, that conversion preserved the expected number of people that would flow out. Of course, this is only correct in the absence of any inflows. Because people that flow in are not eligible to leave the compartment in the same timestep, if we had an annual inflow of 100 people, with `dt=1` there would be `100*(1-0.6)+100 = 140` people in the compartment. Whereas with the flow-preserving conversion, we would have `((100*(1-0.204)+25)*(1-0.204)+25)... = 113.2` so already the presence of any inflows suggests that the predicted compartment sizes under this approximation will not remain the same as the step size is changed. That said, the same is true for the geometric conversion. The difference in the two methods is that while the Poisson conversion preserves neither the annual flow nor the steady state equilibrium, the geometric conversion does preserve the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue with the flow-preserving conversion is that it is not duration-preserving. To see this, consider that the converted probability is being chosen such that applying it some _discrete_ number of times yields the same annual probability. In other words, the cumulative _geometric_ distribution is equal in the two cases. The geometric CDF is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F(k) = 1-(1-p)^k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k$ is the number of steps, and $p$ is the probability at each step. We are setting it so that a timestep probability $p_2$ has the same annual probability $p_1$ for some $k>1$. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "1-(1-p_2)^{k} = 1-(1-p_1)\\\\\n",
    "p_2 = (1-p_1)^{1/k}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k$ is the number of steps per year e.g. if `dt=0.25` then `k=4`. Clearly $p_2 \\neq p_1/k$ but the mean number of samples (the mean of the geometric distribution) is `1/p`, so if both distributions had the same mean, then we would require $p_2 = p_1/k$. Preserving the annual flow (under the no-inflow approximation) is exclusive of preserving the duration even with no inflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, an argument for the geometric scaling can be made based on the probabilities in the steady state. In equilibrium, a compartment contains people that are uniformly distributed over time spent in the compartment. For example, with annual timesteps, in a compartment with a duration of 4 years, 25% of the compartment would be eligible to transition out at the next timestep. Thus, at each timestep, we should move `0.25` of the compartment. If the timestep was quarterly, then 1/16th of the compartment would be due to transition out at the next timestep, so the transition fraction should be `0.0625`. This corresponds to the mean of the distribution for a geometric distribution, which is the operation that is actually performed by the model. "

    "\n",
    "Model integration is ultimately discrete, so in that sense it's logical to use the geometric distribution to consider converting durations to timestep probabilities or converting probabilities between timestep sizes. While this results in different flow rates to the previous conversions, it appears to do a better job of preserving durations, provides more consistent results when changing the step size, and preserves the system's equilibrium solution when changing the step size."
