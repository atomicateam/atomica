    "# T4 - Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics can be conceptually difficult to define, but are fairly simple in practice. They are essentially special parameters, that are specific to working with compartments and groups of compartments. We will motivate their design with a worked example that builds on the multi-population framework from T3, and then conclude by discussing other aspects of their design that differ from parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key functionality provided by characteristics is this - the example in T3 had users initialize the compartment sizes by directly entering values for the number of people in the 'Susceptible' and 'Infected' compartments, both of which appeared on the 'Stocks' sheet in the databook.\n",
    "\n",
    "![t4-framework1](assets/T4/t4_framework_1.png)\n",

    "However, typically country data does not correspond directly to the compartments in the databook. For example, suppose we know \n",
    "\n",
    "- The total number of people alive\n",
    "- The number of people who have ever been infected\n",
    "- The proportion of infections that have now been resolved\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use this data to work out what the corresponding compartment sizes should be. For example, if we know that there are 1000 people in total, of whom 400 have ever been infected, and of which 75% of infections have been resolved, then the corresponding initial compartment sizes would be\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sus = 600`\n",
    "- `inf = 100`\n",
    "- `rec = 300`\n",
    "\n",
    "which satisfies that `sus+inf+rec=1000`, and `inf+rec=400`, and `rec/(inf+rec)=300`. The motivation for characteristics is that we want the databook to contain data entry for the total number of people, the number ever infected, and the proportion resolved, because those are the values corresponding to the available data. We would like Atomica to work out  the corresponding compartment sizes, rather than having to do the calculation manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we need to store the information in the framework that we have quantities\n",
    "\n",
    "- `alive = sus+inf+rec`\n",
    "- `ever_inf = inf+rec`\n",
    "- `prop_resolved = rec/ever_inf` \n",
    "\n",
    "and have these quantities appear in the databook instead of the compartments themselves. We could achieve the required data entry using parameters. However, we can't use the parameters to initialize compartments. This is why there is a separate system, 'characteristics', that allows expressions of groups of compartments to be used for initialization. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can set up the three characteristics defined above in a fairly straightforward way on the 'Characteristics' sheet. Rather than writing the formulas above with '+' and '/' operations, we instead provide a comma separated list of compartments (or other characteristics) to sum (in the 'components' column) and we provide the denominator separately in the 'denominator' column. So the corresponding characteristics sheet is\n",

    "\n",
    "If we create a databook from the framework as usual, we will have updated data entry tables on the 'Stocks' sheet. We can then go ahead and fill them out with the initialization described above:\n",

    "So we have successfully used characteristics to have Atomica automatically convert from the aggregated data values to the underlying compartment values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, we are solving a system of simultaneous equations. What happens if there are more unknowns than there are equations? This corresponds to the system being 'underdetermined'. An example would be, suppose we know that there are 1000 people in total, of whom 400 have ever been infected, but we don't know the proportion of people whose infections have been resolved. How do we then decide whether we have 100 infected and 300 recovered, or 300 infected and 100 recovered? Atomica uses the 'minimum norm' solution which means that the inputs are distributed equally across groups of compartments that are nonzero, and is zero if no information is available. We will see this with two examples. First, consider the case above where we only know the total population size and number ever infected. This corresponds to the framework and databook containing\n",
