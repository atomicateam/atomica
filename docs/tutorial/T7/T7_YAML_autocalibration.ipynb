    "# T7 - YAML calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the earlier calibration tutorial, most autocalibrations involve multiple steps, since the optimization algorithm often gets stuck in local minima if we try to optimize too many parameters at once. We could run each of these steps ourselves through separate calls to `P.calibrate()` – however, there is significant value in being able to explicitly frame the overall calibration process as an algorithm, as this makes it easier to modify the calibration steps and apply the calibration algorithm across a collection of projects. This is implemented in Atomica through the 'YAML calibration' feature, in which the calibration steps are specified in a file which Atomica can then read and use to execute the calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## YAML files\n",
    "\n",
    "The calibration algorithm files used by Atomica are written in YAML. YAML is a plain-text, human-readable data serialization language used to make configuration files. Essentially, a YAML file can be read into Python variables (dictionaries, lists, strings) which in turn can be used as arguments to Python functions. Here is an example of how variables can be specified in a YAML file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " foo: a string\n",
    " bar: 1\n",
    " baz: [a,b,c]\n",
    " list:\n",
    "   - i\n",
    "   - j\n",
    " nested:\n",
    "   x: 1\n",
    "   y: 2\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "When parsed into Python, this becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{'foo': 'a string',\n",
    " 'bar': 1,\n",
    " 'baz': ['a', 'b', 'c'],\n",
    " 'list': ['i', 'j'],\n",
    " 'nested': {'x': 1, 'y': 2}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using YAML files provides a simple way to define a calibration algorithm in a format that is easy to work with and that Atomica can directly execute. This can cut down the time we spend manually calibrating, or even running autocalibrations. It allows us to conduct reproducible calibration runs, and is also highly scalable, since it allows us to apply the same calibration algorithm in multiple countries or settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following tutorial outlines how to use the YAML framework that has been developed for Atomica calibration. Specifically, it will cover how to write a YAML configuration file with calibration instructions for Atomica, and how to use this file to execute a calibration. Bear in mind that YAML calibration is not intended to be a standalone tool that will perfectly calibrate any model – rather, it is one part of the calibration toolbox. It can be used to reduce the time spent on calibration by autocalibrating Atomica models to a reasonable level, but additional tweaking may be required to obtain a consistently high calibration quality across all parameters, populations and/or countries."

Second, there is a large sudden change in the values of several variables right at the start of the simulation.

In this tutorial, we will use YAML files to specify a sequence of steps to calibrate the simple typhoid model shown above, starting with a minimal example and then introducing key features provided by Atomica's YAML calibration system."

    "## Minimal YAML file\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how YAML calibration works, let’s start with a simple example of what a YAML file could look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    calibration:\n",
    "    \tadjustables: b_rate, mig_rate\n",
    "    \tmeasurables: alive\n",
    "\n",
    "The above YAML file represents a single call to the autocalibration optimisation function, where the `b_rate` and `mig_rate` y-factors are adjusted to match `alive`. It is equivalent to running a calibration with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    calibrated_parset = P.calibrate(parset = cal, adjustables = ['b_rate', 'mig_rate'], measurables = 'alive')\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the YAML calibration is very similar to performing a standalone auto-calibration. After saving the YAML file to disk (e.g., `T7_YAML_1_minimal.yaml`), the calibration can be run using\n",
    "\n",
    "    calibrated_parset = P.calibrate(parset = cal, yaml='T7_YAML_1_minimal.yaml')\n",
    "\n",
    "As the YAML calibration framework allows us to specify the adjustables and measurables, it is not necessary to provide them to `Project.calibrate()` – simply providing the YAML file is sufficient. However, the YAML file can contain multiple calibration commands, and therefore a single call to `Project.calibrate()` with a YAML file might be equivalent to multiple explicit calibration steps. The resulting simulation after running this simple calibration is like so: \n",

    "\n",
    "As you can see, these plots don't look very different to the uncalibrated simulation results. If we plot the uncalibrated simulation in the same plot as our simple calibration, we can see that there has been a slight change, but not nearly enough to be able to consider this a good calibration. Next, we will illustrate the YAML calibration features that we can use to improve on this initial result. "

    "## Sections\n",
    "\n",
    "At the most basic level, a YAML calibration file defines a sequence of individual steps, where each step incrementally modifies the calibration. The YAML file therefore defines an overall _algorithm_ for performing an automatic calibration. This algorithm is defined using two structures in the YAML file:\n",

    "- _actions_, which are associated with particular operations, like running a gradient-descent calibration step with a particular set of parameters and data. A calibration action contains `adjustables` and `measurables`. Other examples of actions are detailed below.\n",

    "\n",
    "The original YAML file above consisted of a single calibration action. If we wanted to extend the algorithm by adding a step to calibrate the death rate, we could update our YAML file to the following: \n",

    "In some models, this can be treated as a 'burn-in' period and the initial part of the simulation can simply be discarded. However, there is a risk that being too far from the correct initialization results in contamination of the estimates of parameters during the calibration period. For example, if the model is initialized with the incorrect prevalence, the calibration applied to the force of infection in order to match the observed incidence would be impacted, which might subsequently affect the model's sensitivity to interventions that change the prevalence later on. Therefore, we wish to minimize the effect of the transient on the calibration. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can sometimes achieve this by setting the calibration start year `cal_start` to be a few years after the simulation start year `sim_start`, so that the simulation has a few years to reach equilibrium before the calibration process itself begins. However, this extends the duration of the simulation, or might limit the amount of data used for the calibraiton.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach is to override the initialisation for our calibration. Initialisations work by running a normal Atomica simulation for a few years (past the initial transient), taking the compartment sizes of that future year, and setting the initial compartment sizes to those stabilized values. In cases where the model parameters are mostly constant, these future compartment sizes will be roughly equivalent to what the initial compartment sizes should be, which will avoid the initial transient in the model. \n",

    "If the model parameters are not roughly constant, the equilibrium that the model converges to in the future might not correspond to the equilibrium solution for the model's initial parameter values. In that case, an initial transient will still occur. To address this, we can remove any time variation in the model's parameter values using the `ParameterSet.make_constant()` method. This will return a copy of the parset in which all parameters are constant over time, thus ensuring that the future compartment sizes are computed based on the same parameter values as the initial simulation year. This often provides a suitable solution, although changes to the total population size due to births and deaths can still take place, so in some cases an initial transient may still be present. In such cases, repeatedly setting initialization based on a shorter simulation can help minimize the discrepancy. For more information on Atomica initializations, see the [documentation](/general/YAML_calibration.html).\n",

To save a calibration, we simply make a section titled `save_calibration`. Under the title, we can indicate the filename we wish to save the calibration to, either by providing it directly, or by using the keyword `fname` - both examples are shown below:\n",

    "\n",
    "We saw previously that sections (i.e. YAML blocks that don't correspond to actions) don't directly modify the calibration, and are mainly used to structure the YAML file. However, it is possible to determine calibration settings inside a section, such that they are passed down to any subsections or action blocks contained within. Another way to think of this is that an action block will inherit any settings that are defined in any of its parent sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can simplify the process of writing YAML files where we want to override the default settings in several action blocks, as it allows us to specify those settings once in a parent section, rather than repeatedly in every action block. Additionally, this feature is hierarchical, so settings that are specified further in (e.g. in the action block itself) will always override those set in a section that is further out, allowing for more flexibility.\n",

    "- `max_time`: Maximum amount of time each call to the optimisation algorithm will run for \n",
    "- `stepsize`: Initial stepsize, i.e. how much the y-factors will be incremented/decreased by in the optimisation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, any adjustable or measurable setting can also be set outside of its calibration block, although some settings lend themselves more to this feature than others. For example, changing the measurable `weight` for an entire calibration block has no effect, as what matters is the proportion between the weights of different measurables in the same block. The following settings can be useful to set in parent sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `cal_start` and `cal_end`: These can be used to change the calibration timespan for multiple calibration steps at the same time.\n",

    "In this tutorial we have demonstrated the key functionality of Atomica's YAML calibration system applied to a population calibration, focussing on adjusting births and deaths to match population size data, without considering disease burden. This same functionality applies to epidemiological calibration, just with different model parameters and data. A complete YAML file of the population and epidemiological calibration can be found in the `Worked_example` folder in code repository, in the `typ_calibration_instructions.yaml` file. \n",

This can be useful to do since, before calibrating the disease, the magnitude of the disease parameters could be large enough to significantly inmpact the population calibration results. \n",

    "In the epidemiological calibration section, the typhoid incidence, prevalence, and typhoid deaths are calibrated. Since we don't have a lot of information on the order of magnitude of the susceptibility and infectiousness, the lower and upper bounds are expanded to leave more room for variation. However, we don't want the disease duration `typ_gen_dur` to vary a lot, since we have a pretty clear idea of its magnitude and don't want it to vary too much between calibrations and settings, so we set stricter bounds. \n",
