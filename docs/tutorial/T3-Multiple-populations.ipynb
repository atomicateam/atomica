    "In this tutorial, we will examine how to work with simulations that have more than one population. At the simplest level, multiple populations simply involve instantiating multiple copies of the framework's compartment structure. Of course, much of the value of having multiple populations comes from them being able to affect each other, leading to different epidemic dynamics. There are two ways in which populations can affect each other in Atomica\n",

Effectively, a simulation with multiple populations can be considered a single, large network of compartments, with duplicate compartment names across populations, and transfers being links that connect those compartments. Defining a transfer in a databook then corresponds to setting a transfer rate between all corresponding compartments in the selected populations, as shown below.\n",

    "The second way that populations can affect each other is via parameters. Because we are working with parameters, this takes place primarily in the framework, so it is independent of the populations that actually end up being instantiated. Cross-population parameters are implemented by either summing or averaging parameters across populations, using the special functions `SRC_POP_SUM` and `SRC_POP_AVG`. In this case, we have a certain prevalence and infectiousness in each population, leading to a force of infection within each population. However, we want to account for the fact that the total force of infection depends on the prevalance in other populations as well. The net force of infection can be expressed as a weighted average of the force of infection in all populations, with different weights in every population.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, we will first set up the force of infection as an unweighted average, and then introduce weights. We start by splitting the `foi` parameter into two parameters - `foi_out` which is the force of infection computed within each population only, and `foi_in`, which is the force of infection taking into account cross-population interactions. This naming reflects the idea that `foi_out` reflects 'outgoing' disease from the population, while `foi_in` reflects the aggregation of infectiousness driving 'incoming' disease in the population. \n",

Therefore, we can create a project using the new framework but with the databook from the previous example.
