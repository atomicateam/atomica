    "However, a key function of Atomica is to model the impact of interventions. These interventions are typically framed in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The intervention has a unit cost associated with it (e.g. a treatment that costs \\$100/person)\n",
    "- A specified amount of money is made available for the intervention (e.g. \\$1000/year)\n",
    "- The intervention defines a parameter value (matching a parameter in the Framework) for people reached by the intervention. For example, the natural recovery rate for a rate for individuals on treatment may be 20\\%, but if someone is on treatment, they have a 90\\% chance of recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, the calculation we wish to implement is as follows. Suppose we have an SIR model and there are 100 people infected and diagnosed at the start of the year. The \\$1000 of available funding means that 10 people can be treated that year. Of those 10 people, 90\\% of them recover, leading to 9 people moving to the 'Recovered' state. For the remaining 90 people, 20\\% of them recover, leading to 18 natural recoveries. So that year, a total of 27 people will move from 'Infected' to 'Recovered'. \n",

    "In the calculation above, the natural recovery rate of 20\\% is readily entered in the databook. However, we wish to parametrize the effect of the intervention in terms of spending, unit cost, and the impact of the intervention for those it reaches. Although it would be possible to implement the calculation via parameter functions, it quickly becomes cumbersome if there are multiple interventions affecting the same model parameter. Therefore, we introduce a second pathway for calculating parameter values, using **'Programs'**. A schematic overview of how programs relate to model parameter values is shown below: \n",

The flow in the model should be set up as `S -> I -> D -> R` (with death flows due to background deaths and disease-related death set up accordingly. Set up your model so that there is no natural recovery rate (i.e. people must be diagnosed or eventually die from the 'Infected' compartment, and people must be treated or eventually die from the 'Diagnosed' compartment). \n",
