Each node has associated with it a collection of attributes/settings defined for that node (`instructions`), and a collection of attributes inherited from all parent nodes (`context`). The `atomica.yaml_calibration.build()` function takes in the content of the YAML file and loads it into a tree of `at.yaml_calibration.BaseNode` instances with a root node called 'calibration' at the top level.
