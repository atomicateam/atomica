class ProgramInstructions:
    """
    Store instructions for applying programs

    A :class:`ProgramSet` contains a Python representation of the program book, with
    a collection of programs, their effects, and quantities like historical spending.
    However, to run a simulation with programs, additional information is required - for
    example, which year to switch from databook parameters to program-computed parameters.
    This type of information is specific to the simulation being run, rather than being an
    intrinsic property of a set of programs. Therefore, that information is stored in
    a :class:`ProgramInstructions` instance.

    At minimum, the :class:`ProgramInstructions` must contain the year to turn on programs.
    It can also optionally contain the year to turn off programs. In addition to the start/stop
    years, the :class:`ProgramInstructions` also contains any overwrites that should be applied
    to

    - Spending (in units of people/year)
    - Capacity (in units of people/year)
    - Fraction/proportion coverage

    which thus provides the underlying implementation for program-related scenarios. The
    :class:`ProgramSet` and :class:`Program` methods access and use the :class:`ProgramInstructions`
    instances. The overwrites for spending in particular are widely used - for example, budget
    optimization is a mapping from one set of :class:`ProgramInstructions` to another, and thus
    during optimization, :class:`ProgramInstructions` instances are used to test different allocations.

    Note that the program calculation proceeds by

    1. Using spending and unit cost to compute capacity
    2. Using capacity and the compartment sizes to compute fractional coverage
    3. Using fractional coverage to compute program outcomes

    Overwrites to each quantity (spending, capacity, coverage) are applied at their
    respective stages, so if the :class:`ProgramInstructions` contains more than one
    type of overwrite, they will be applied in this same order (and later stages
    will take precedence e.g. if both capacity and coverage are overwritten, it will be
    the coverage overwrite that impacts the final parameter value).

    Finally, for simplicity, if an overwrite is provided, it entirely replaces the values
    in the program book, in contrast to parameter scenarios, which contain more complex logic
    for interpolating between databook and scenario values.

    :param start_year: Year to switch to program-calculated parameters
    :param stop_year: Year to switch back to databook parameters
    :param alloc: The allocation. It can be
              - A dict keyed by program name, containing a scalar spend, or a TimeSeries of spending values. If the spend is
                scalar, it will be assigned to the start year
              - A ProgramSet instance, in which case an allocation will be assigned by interpolating the ProgramSet's
                spending onto the program start year. This is a shortcut to ensure that budget scenarios and optimizations
                where spending is specified in future years ramp correctly from the program start year (and not the last year
                that data was entered for)
    :param capacity: Overwrites to capacity. This is a dict keyed by program name, containing a scalar capacity or a TimeSeries of capacity values
                     For convenience, the capacity overwrite should be in units of 'people/year' and it will be automatically
                     converted to a per-timestep value based on the units for the program's unit cost.
    :param coverage: Overwrites to proportion coverage. This is a dict keyed by program name, containing a scalar coverage or a TimeSeries of coverage values
