    pchip interpolation with constant extrapolation

    Atomica's standard interpolation routine is based on the pchip method. However, when
    extrapolation is desired (such as when interpolating parameters), it is most useful to
    assume the derivative is zero outside the original range of the function, rather than
    the default pchip behaviour of extrapolating with constant gradient.
