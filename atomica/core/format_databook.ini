comment=This column is for the full name of a transfer.
		A transfer is a movement of entities between populations,
		which, by default, is from compartment to corresponding
		compartment.
		The flow number is, by default, distributed in proportion
		to the size of all compartments in the source population.
		A common example is 'Aging', where a specified fraction of
		people in one age bracket move per year to the next age
		bracket.
		The full name will appear in plots and analysis outputs.

		Note: It should be in title or sentence case.
