header=Option Display Name
comment=This column is for the 'display name' of one option that a population 
        attribute defined in previous columns can be.
        If no attribute was named on the same row, this option belongs 
        to the classification defined in the nearest row above.
        Examples include 'Human' or 'Mosquito' for species, 'Male' or 'Female' 
        for sex, 'HIV-infected' or 'HIV-uninfected' for coinfection status, 
        etc.
        There is no restriction on the number of options per attribute.

[itemtype_comp]
descriptor=Compartment
default_amount=6
[attribute_comp_label]
header=Display Name
comment=This column is for the 'display name' of a compartment within a 
        population cascade, a state that an entity can exist in that is 
        distinct from all other states.
        Examples may include 'Susceptible', 'Infected Stage 1', 'Recovered', 
        etc.
        If entities in the network involve two 'orthogonal' descriptors, 
        compartments should combine the status of each state in the title, 
        e.g. 'High Income Earner + Year 12 Education', to make sure that each 
        entity in a cascade is only ever in one state at a time.
        It is possible to bundle independent states as analytical features of 
        interest elsewhere in the framework file.

prefix=comp
[attribute_comp_is_source]
header=Is Source
comment=This column is for tagging a compartment as an abstract 'source' state, 
        from which entities can flow into the rest of a network.
        Compartment inflows are prohibited, compartment size is meaningless 
        and, accordingly, compartment outflows cannot be specified in relative 
        format.
        This tag should only be enabled for sources of network flows that are 
        not intrinsically bound by size, e.g. births or immigration.
        Flows from sources can still be dependent on other variables in the 
        cascade, e.g. if births are controlled by parental population size, 
        while migrations between populations are considered transfers, 
        i.e. between sets of compartments, and do not involve source nodes.

        Note: This tag is only enabled for a compartment by marking the 
        corresponding cell 'y'. 
        Anything else, including keeping the cell blank, disables the tag.
[attribute_comp_is_sink]
header=Is Sink
comment=This column is for tagging a compartment as an abstract 'sink' state, 
        into which entities can flow from the rest of a network.
        Compartment outflows are prohibited and compartment size denotes  
        the accumulation of all inflowing entities from the start of 
        simulation, the utility of which the user must judge on their own.
        This tag should only be enabled for sinks of network flows that mark 
        the exit of entities from further involvement in a cascade, e.g. deaths 
        and emigration.
        Migrations between populations are considered transfers, i.e. between 
        sets of compartments, and do not involve sink nodes.

        Note: This tag is only enabled for a compartment by marking the 
        corresponding cell 'y'.
        Anything else, including keeping the cell blank, disables the tag.
[attribute_comp_is_junction]
header=Is Junction
comment=This column is for tagging a compartment as an abstract 'junction' 
        state, commonly used to control the aggregation and disaggregation of 
        network flows.
        These special nodes are designed to empty out their contents 
        immediately after collecting inflow, meaning that they will never 
        accumulate any entities at any point in time.
        Accordingly, compartment size is always zero and there must always be 
        at least one compartment outflow, each of which must be specified in 
        weighted format.
        Inflowing entities will be flushed out to connected states in 
        proportion with the weights of the outflowing transitions.
        Models using junctions must be well designed, as a recursion limit will 
        break networks involving endless cycles during simulation runtime.

        Note: This tag is only enabled for a compartment by marking the 
        corresponding cell 'y'.
        Anything else, including keeping the cell blank, disables the tag.
[attribute_comp_datapage]
header=Databook Page
comment=This column optionally marks whether a data-input section should 
        appear for this compartment in a custom databook sheet, if allowed 
        to appear at all according to 'databook order'.
        Each value should be a code name for a desired page defined in 
        the 'custom databook pages' worksheet page.
        If a cell is left empty, the enabled data-input section should appear 
        in a default databook page dedicated to state variables.
[attribute_comp_datapage_order]
header=Databook Order
comment=This column currently denotes whether a databook should request 
		values from the user for the historical size of this compartment.
		A value of '-1' suppresses it from appearing in the databook.
[attribute_comp_setup_weight]
comment_yscale=4
header=Setup Weight
comment=This column determines how important user-provided values for this 
		compartment are to setting up the initial state of a model.
		In general, the column value should be '1' if model construction 
		directly depends on what the user provides for compartment size.
		It should be '0' if supplied values are only for calibration or 
		note-keeping purposes.
		In this latter case, the linear-algebra method of setting up 
		compartment sizes may complain about an 'under-determined' system 
		during a model run.
		To avoid this, every zero-weighted compartment should be matched 
		by a 'characteristic' defined in a later spreadsheet that includes 
		this compartment and is not weighted zero for setup weight.
		
		Note: Default value, i.e. a blank cell, is '1'.
		Framework file parsing should also warn the user about a compartment 
		with nonzero setup weight that is suppressed in the databook, i.e. 
		has a databook order of '-1'.
		

[itemtype_charac]
descriptor=Characteristic
default_amount=10
[attribute_charac_label]
header=Display Name
comment=This column is for the 'display name' of a cascade characteristic, 
        which is a set of compartments or, recursively, other characteristics.
        While a characteristic value is typically the population size across 
        a set of compartments at a point in time, it can also be normalized by 
        another characteristic.
        Defining a characteristic allows the model to track other important 
        system state variables beyond the size of just one compartment.
        Examples include 'Number of People Alive', 'Number of Infections Across 
        All Strains', 'Proportion of People Immune', etc.
        Importantly, each compartment defined elsewhere also serves as a 
        characteristic.

        Note: A display name is a representative label that users interface 
        with (e.g. in databooks and plots). 
        It should be in title or sentence case.

prefix=charac
[attribute_charac_includes]
header=Components
comment=This column, and any that immediately follow without a specified 
        header, is for the 'components' of a cascade characteristic. 
        A component is either a compartment or a characteristic that has 
        been previously defined, i.e. in a previous row, and should be 
        listed in this (and appropriate subsequent columns) by 'Code Name'.
        For example, characteristic 'infected' may include 'dis_stage_1', 
        'dis_stage_2' and 'dis_advanced', where 'dis_advanced' is another 
        previously-defined characteristic including 'dis_stage_3' and 
        'dis_stage_4'.
        In an example model, 'infected' would track population size summed 
        across the four 'dis_stage' states.

        Note: If two or more components are listed in the same column, they 
        must be separated by a comma.
        Whitespace is allowable and will be deleted during processing.

[itemtype_par]
descriptor=Parameter
default_amount=15
[attribute_par_label]
header=Display Name
comment=This column is for the 'display name' of a cascade parameter.
        The base case is referred to as a transition parameter, referring to 
        the flow of entities between compartments.
        However, due to the option of specifying transition rates as functions 
        of other parameters, a parameter can be any variable that directly or 
        indirectly affects the rate of population change in the network.
        Examples include 'Birth Rate', 'Treatment Uptake Rate', 'Internet 
        Coverage', etc.

        Note: A display name is a representative label that users interface 
        with (e.g. in databooks and plots).
