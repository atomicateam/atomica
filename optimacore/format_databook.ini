comment=This column should be filled with default values used by the 
		model.
		If the option to provide time-dependent values exists, then 
		this can be considered a time-independent assumption.
		In this case, if any time-dependent values are entered, the 
		Excel sheet will attempt to explicitly mark the corresponding 
		cell as inapplicable.
		Alternatively, the user can leave the cell blank.
		However, any other value will override the time-dependent 
		values during a model run.
