[header_classlabel]
name=Classification Display Name
comment=This column is for the 'display name' of a relevant classification set 
        for populations within the model, such as 'Species', 'Sex', 
        'Coinfection Status', etc.
        This classification should be distinct from any states of primary focus 
        within a population 'cascade' network.
        Note: A display name is a representative label that users interface 
        with (e.g. in databooks and plots). 
        It should be in title or sentence case.

[header_classname]
name=Classification Code Name
comment=This column is for the 'code name' of a relevant classification set 
        for populations within the model, such as 'c_spec', 'c_sex', 'c_coinf', 
        etc.
        This classification should be distinct from any states of primary focus 
        within a population 'cascade' network.
        Note: A code name is a representative key that developers interface 
        with (e.g. in scripts and the codebase).
        It should be in lower case without spaces.
        
[header_catlabel]
name=Category Display Name
comment=This column is for the 'display name' of a category within a 
        classification set defined in previous columns for populations within 
        the model.
        If no classification was named on the same row, this category belongs 
        to the classification defined in the nearest row above.
        Examples may include 'Human' or 'Mosquito' for species, 'Male' or 
        'Female' for sex, 'HIV-infected' or 'HIV-uninfected' for coinfection 
        status, etc.
        There is no restriction on the number of categories per classification.
        Note: A display name is a representative label that users interface 
        with (e.g. in databooks and plots). 
        It should be in title or sentence case.

[header_catname]
name=Category Code Name
comment=This column is for the 'code name' of a category within a 
        classification set defined in previous columns for populations within 
        the model.
        If no classification was named on the same row, this category belongs 
        to the classification defined in the nearest row above.
        Examples may include 'spec_hum' or 'spec_mos' for species, 'sex_m' or 
        'sex_f' for sex, 'hiv_inf' or 'hiv_uninf' for coinfection status, etc.
        There is no restriction on the number of categories per classification.
        Note: A code name is a representative key that developers interface 
        with (e.g. in scripts and the codebase).
        It should be in lower case without spaces.
        
[sheet_comp]
name=Compartments
headers=complabel,compname

[header_complabel]
name=Display Name
comment=This column is for the 'display name' of a compartment within a 
        population cascade, a state that an entity can exist in that is 
        distinct from all other states.
        Examples may include 'Susceptible', 'Infected Stage 1', 'Recovered', 
        etc.
        If entities in the network involve two 'orthogonal' descriptors, 
        compartments should combine the status of each state in the title, 
        e.g. 'High Income Earner + Year 12 Education', to make sure that each 
        entity in a cascade is only ever in one state at a time.
        It is possible to bundle independent states as analytical features of 
        interest elsewhere in the framework file.
        Note: A display name is a representative label that users interface 
        with (e.g. in databooks and plots). 
        It should be in title or sentence case.

[header_compname]
name=Code Name
comment=This column is for the 'code name' of a compartment within a 
        population cascade, a state that an entity can exist in that is 
        distinct from all other states.
        Examples may include 'sus', 'inf_1', 'rec', etc.
        If entities in the network involve two 'orthogonal' descriptors, 
        compartments should combine the status of each state in the title, 
        e.g. 'inc_high_ed_hs', to make sure that each entity in a cascade is 
        only ever in one state at a time.
        It is possible to bundle independent states as analytical features of
