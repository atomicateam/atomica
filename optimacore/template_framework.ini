[column_poptype_attlabel]
header=Attribute Display Name
comment=This column is for the 'display name' of a relevant attribute for 
        populations within the model, such as 'Species', 'Sex', 
        'Coinfection Status', etc.
        This classification should be distinct from any states of primary focus 
        within a population 'cascade' network.
        Note: A display name is a representative label that users interface 
        with (e.g. in databooks and plots). 
        It should be in title or sentence case.

[column_poptype_attname]
header=Attribute Code Name
comment=This column is for the 'code name' of a relevant attribute for 
        populations within the model, such as 'c_spec', 'c_sex', 'c_coinf', 
        etc.
        This classification should be distinct from any states of primary focus 
        within a population 'cascade' network.
        Note: A code name is a representative key that developers interface 
        with (e.g. in scripts and the codebase).
        It should be in lower case without spaces.

[column_poptype_optlabel]
header=Option Display Name
comment=This column is for the 'display name' of one option that a population 
        attribute defined in previous columns can be.
        If no attribute was named on the same row, this option belongs 
        to the classification defined in the nearest row above.
        Examples may include 'Human' or 'Mosquito' for species, 'Male' or 
        'Female' for sex, 'HIV-infected' or 'HIV-uninfected' for coinfection 
        status, etc.
        There is no restriction on the number of options per attribute.
        Note: A display name is a representative label that users interface 
        with (e.g. in databooks and plots). 
        It should be in title or sentence case.

[column_poptype_optname]
header=Option Code Name
comment=This column is for the 'code name' of one option that a population 
        attribute defined in previous columns can be.
        If no attribute was named on the same row, this option belongs 
        to the classification defined in the nearest row above.
        Examples may include 'spec_hum' or 'spec_mos' for species, 'sex_m' or 
        'sex_f' for sex, 'hiv_inf' or 'hiv_uninf' for coinfection status, etc.
        There is no restriction on the number of options per attribute.

column_width=15

[column_comp_label]
header=Display Name
comment=This column is for the 'display name' of a compartment within a 
        population cascade, a state that an entity can exist in that is 
        distinct from all other states.
        Examples may include 'Susceptible', 'Infected Stage 1', 'Recovered', 
        etc.
        If entities in the network involve two 'orthogonal' descriptors, 
        compartments should combine the status of each state in the title, 
        e.g. 'High Income Earner + Year 12 Education', to make sure that each 
        entity in a cascade is only ever in one state at a time.
        It is possible to bundle independent states as analytical features of 
        interest elsewhere in the framework file.
        Note: A display name is a representative label that users interface 
        with (e.g. in databooks and plots). 
        It should be in title or sentence case.

comment=This column is for the 'code name' of a compartment within a 
        population cascade, a state that an entity can exist in that is

        Examples may include 'sus', 'inf_1', 'rec', etc.
        If entities in the network involve two 'orthogonal' descriptors, 
        compartments should combine the status of each state in the title, 
        e.g. 'inc_high_ed_hs', to make sure that each entity in a cascade is 
        only ever in one state at a time.

[column_comp_sourcetag]
header=Is Source
comment=This column is for tagging a compartment as an abstract 'source' state, 
        from which entities can flow into the rest of a network.
        Compartment inflows are prohibited, compartment size is meaningless 
        and, accordingly, compartment outflows cannot be specified in relative 
        format.
        This tag should only be enabled for sources of network flows that are 
        not intrinsically bound by size, e.g. births or immigration.
        Flows from sources can still be dependent on other variables in the 
        cascade, e.g. if births are controlled by parental population size, 
        while migrations between populations are considered transfers, 
        i.e. between sets of compartments, and do not involve source nodes.
        Note: This tag is only enabled for a compartment by marking the 
        corresponding cell 'y'. 
        Anything else, including keeping the cell blank, disables the tag.

[column_comp_sinktag]
header=Is Sink
comment=This column is for tagging a compartment as an abstract 'sink' state, 
        into which entities can flow from the rest of a network.
        Compartment outflows are prohibited and compartment size denotes  
        the accumulation of all inflowing entities from the start of 
        simulation, the utility of which the user must judge on their own.
        This tag should only be enabled for sinks of network flows that mark 
        the exit of entities from further involvement in a cascade, e.g. deaths 
        and emigration.
        Migrations between populations are considered transfers, i.e. between 
        sets of compartments, and do not involve sink nodes.
        Note: This tag is only enabled for a compartment by marking the 
        corresponding cell 'y'.
        Anything else, including keeping the cell blank, disables the tag.

[column_comp_junctiontag]
header=Is Junction
comment=This column is for tagging a compartment as an abstract 'junction' 
        state, commonly used to control the aggregation and disaggregation of 
        network flows.
        These special nodes are designed to empty out their contents 
        immediately after collecting inflow, meaning that they will never 
        accumulate any entities at any point in time.
        Accordingly, compartment size is always zero and there must always be 
        at least one compartment outflow, each of which must be specified in 
        weighted format.
        Inflowing entities will be flushed out to connected states in 
        proportion with the weights of the outflowing transitions.
        Models using junctions must be well designed, as a recursion limit will 
        break networks involving endless cycles during simulation runtime.
        Note: This tag is only enabled for a compartment by marking the 
        corresponding cell 'y'.
        Anything else, including keeping the cell blank, disables the tag.
