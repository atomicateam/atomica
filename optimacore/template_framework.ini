[column_poptype_attlabel]
name=Attribute Display Name
comment=This column is for the 'display name' of a relevant attribute for 
        populations within the model, such as 'Species', 'Sex', 
        'Coinfection Status', etc.
        This classification should be distinct from any states of primary focus 
        within a population 'cascade' network.
        Note: A display name is a representative label that users interface 
        with (e.g. in databooks and plots). 
        It should be in title or sentence case.

[column_poptype_attname]
name=Attribute Code Name
comment=This column is for the 'code name' of a relevant attribute for 
        populations within the model, such as 'c_spec', 'c_sex', 'c_coinf', 
        etc.
        This classification should be distinct from any states of primary focus 
        within a population 'cascade' network.
        Note: A code name is a representative key that developers interface 
        with (e.g. in scripts and the codebase).
        It should be in lower case without spaces.
        
[column_poptype_optlabel]
name=Option Display Name
comment=This column is for the 'display name' of one option that a population 
        attribute defined in previous columns can be.
        If no attribute was named on the same row, this option belongs 
        to the classification defined in the nearest row above.
        Examples may include 'Human' or 'Mosquito' for species, 'Male' or 
        'Female' for sex, 'HIV-infected' or 'HIV-uninfected' for coinfection 
        status, etc.
        There is no restriction on the number of options per attribute.
        Note: A display name is a representative label that users interface 
        with (e.g. in databooks and plots). 
        It should be in title or sentence case.

[column_poptype_optname]
name=Option Code Name
comment=This column is for the 'code name' of one option that a population 
        attribute defined in previous columns can be.
        If no attribute was named on the same row, this option belongs 
        to the classification defined in the nearest row above.
        Examples may include 'spec_hum' or 'spec_mos' for species, 'sex_m' or 
        'sex_f' for sex, 'hiv_inf' or 'hiv_uninf' for coinfection status, etc.
        There is no restriction on the number of options per attribute.
        Note: A code name is a representative key that developers interface 
        with (e.g. in scripts and the codebase).
        It should be in lower case without spaces.

[column_comp_label]
name=Display Name
comment=This column is for the 'display name' of a compartment within a 
        population cascade, a state that an entity can exist in that is 
        distinct from all other states.
        Examples may include 'Susceptible', 'Infected Stage 1', 'Recovered', 
        etc.
        If entities in the network involve two 'orthogonal' descriptors, 
        compartments should combine the status of each state in the title, 
        e.g. 'High Income Earner + Year 12 Education', to make sure that each 
        entity in a cascade is only ever in one state at a time.
        It is possible to bundle independent states as analytical features of 
        interest elsewhere in the framework file.
        Note: A display name is a representative label that users interface 
        with (e.g. in databooks and plots). 
        It should be in title or sentence case.

[column_comp_name]
name=Code Name
comment=This column is for the 'code name' of a compartment within a 
        population cascade, a state that an entity can exist in that is 
        distinct from all other states.
        Examples may include 'sus', 'inf_1', 'rec', etc.
        If entities in the network involve two 'orthogonal' descriptors, 
        compartments should combine the status of each state in the title, 
        e.g. 'inc_high_ed_hs', to make sure that each entity in a cascade is 
        only ever in one state at a time.
